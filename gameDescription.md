In Punch Dungeon, you spawn in a dungeon in an underworld setting, where you 
wake up and immediately notice you are equipped with boxing gloves. The goal of the 
game is to escape the dungeon, which can only be done by winning boxing matches 
and finding your way out.  At the beginning, you start with a low amount of health, 
punching power, and defense. When you look at the fighters as you explore, they are 
detailed with a difficulty ranking of 1-6. From weakest to strongest, the fighters are 
“Hank the Tank”, “Tortilla-Chip-Jones”, “Speedy-Gonzalez”, “Doctor-Punch-Ya-Face”, 
“Ko-Kraig the Killer Kroc”, with the strongest fighter at 6/6 difficulty being “Tike Myson”. 
The fighters are scattered around the map (see below), and it is up to you to navigate 
around and find them, hopefully then knocking them out. The fighting system is a simple 
punch/defend choice game, where punches can be reduced by defending. When you 
win a fight, you receive upgrades to your attributes, such as more health, power, and 
defense buffers. As you explore, you may stumble across some weird hieroglyphics, a 
random music box, and a pair of golden boxing loves that can give you some extra help. 
There also may be some fallen fighters, and even some still boxing, who you might want 
to watch out for. Be mindful and cautious, as context clues play a vital role in completing 
Punch Dungeon. It is important to fight hard, as once you are knocked out, the game is 
over, and you lose.

*Spoilers Ahead* 

Once all 6 fighters have been knocked out by the user, a scribe will fall from the ceiling 
in the room the last fighter was knocked out in, reading a strange message detailing the 
fact that Julius ‘CAESAR’ was named dictator perpetuo in the year -44. This scribe 
combined with the realization that the music box is playing a song called ‘CIPHER’ by 
Kevin Macleod can be used that the hieroglyphics found in one of the rooms can be 
translated using a Caesar Cipher shift by the key of -44. The translation instructs the 
user to go and find the dead skeleton, revealed to be an old friend of the user, and wish 
him a happy birthday. Once the user completes this task, the skeleton will rise from the 
dead and give the user the obsidian-key. This key can then be used to unlock the 
mysterious obsidian-door and win the game, completing Punch Dungeon. 

I have listed out the commands to input to win the game if you would like to breeze through
or are feeling stuck. Make sure you are running 'punchDungeon.py' as that is the main file.
